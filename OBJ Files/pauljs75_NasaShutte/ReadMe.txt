Description: Nasa Shuttle Orbiter.

Restrictions: Released under GPLv2.

-----[Release date: 2008-09-26]-----

Notes: This release is UV'd and has included template guides for painting/texturing of the exterior, interior bay, engines, and braking chute bags. However there are no complete (as in already painted) texture sets at this time, so you will have to use the guides to create your own. Materials in this model are only set up as guides, and you will need to adjust them for rendering. Also this model is released under terms of the GPLv2 as content which is covered under paragraph 0. This is so the model can be compatable with uses in software other than that for artistic rendering. (ie: sims or games) Artists can simply treat the model as they would something under CC-SA, and there shouldn't be any problems. (I'd actually even dual license, but it seems some small details don't make the two 100% compatable.)

-----[Release date: 2008-09-28]-----

Notes: Some basic textures have now been added in addition to the UV maps. The model still defaults to the templates for texture association, so you will have to link the texture images manually in your shaders/materials in order to use them.

Modeling and UV work are done in Wings3D, a free and open source modeler. See www.wings3d.com for more info.
